# Publishing Masters thesis and/or internship work

The purpose of this document is to establish guidelines that will help you, the master's student/intern, understand what to anticipate when it comes to publishing the findings from your work in an academic journal.

## During the thesis/internship

The academic supervisor is expected to:

- provide clear guidelines about what work needs to be done, how, and to what standard
- check in frequently to ensure that the project is on track and, if not, to adapt
- provide the necessary access to tools, readings, and experiences in a timely manner
- plan the work such that the student has true opportunities to learn about the research process
- give guidance on good writing practices and clear writing style
- adhere to any other official responsibilities of supervision via the student's/intern's institution
- give the student/intern opportunities to make intellectual contributions if the agreed-upon aim is to try for publication of a journal article

The student/intern is expected to:

- carry out the work in accordance with the guidelines
- keep daily notes on all doubts, decisions, and progress
- share the notes these with the supervisor at regular meetings (or in a regular update email)
- complete the work in a timely manner
- ensure that all related official paperwork is processed by the required deadlines at the student's/intern's institution
- ensure that the supervisor has a copy of all official paperwork and is cognizant of relevant institutional deadlines for the thesis/internship


## Publishing the research project

Toward the end of the internship, the student/intern and their academic supervisor(s) should meet to discuss the possibility of publishing the research project. Publication may be the intention from the beginning of the project, but it is not guaranteed be attempted until the committee agree together on a final set of guidelines.

At the beginning of the research project, and again toward the end, the committee should discuss the following topics:

- Does the student/intern want to pursue a career in academia?
- Where does the idea for the research project come from?
- Where do the research tasks and their guidelines (e.g., for data collection, annotation, and analysis) come from?
- How likely are the findings to be of interest to the broader academic community in their present form?
- What timing constraints does the student/intern anticipate facing after the thesis/internship report is technically complete (i.e., the time afterward when the work is converted to a journal article)?

The student/intern will only be a co-author on the publication of the work they contribute to if the following conditions are met:

- The results of the study are sufficient for scientific report (e.g., no further data collection/annotation/analysis is required to make the study publishable).
- The student/intern makes intellectual contributions to the research.
- The student/intern takes primary writing responsibility while also ensuring that the work is submitted to a journal within **four** months of the end of their internship/thesis period.
- The student/intern continues to be responsive to feedback and reminders from the supervisor(s) until the work is published.

If the student/intern is unable to sustain these conditions, their contribution will be acknowledged as a non-author in any future journal publication using the work. Changes to these guidelines can be agreed upon by the supervisor(s) for exceptional circumstances, but must be documented elsewhere.

# Agreement Bram, Paula, and Marisa:

Bram will attempt to write his Radboud Masters thesis as a journal article, with the goal of submitting it for review by September 2020. If he takes primary responsibility for writing and makes some intellectual contributions to the work, he will serve as the first author of the submitted work. If he is unable to achieve both of these points, he will instead be expected to write up his findings in a traditional masters thesis format, and Marisa will publish the work on her own after the thesis is complete.

**The latest possible journal submission date for Bram is end of January 2020.** After that date, Marisa will take over publication of the project, acknowledging Bram's work as a non-author contribution. These terms can be negotiated again later in 2020, if needed.

During Bram's thesis period, it is Marisa and Paula's responsibility to provide guidance about staying on-track with annotation, analysis, and writing goals. It is Bram's responsibility to follow through on these guidelines and to produce high quality work in a timely manner.

_Note:_ Any potential research presentations related to the project, but outside of the masters thesis requirements, must be agreed upon by Bram, Marisa, and Paula. In principle, if the project is on track and Bram is making contributions as a first author, at least one Bram-led research presentation in connection with the project would be encouraged to aid in his future research career.
