# Kinship NL Draaiboek
In this study we are trying to find out what Dutch children ages 5–17 know about Dutch kinship terms (e.g., moeder, oom, neef), who they know in their own extended family, and what they know about the nature of their relationship to their kin.

This study is meant as a comparison sample to a group of ~70 kids of the same age tested on Rossel Island in PNG (collected by Marisa and Steve in 2018). That said, there is some interesting, Dutch-specific information that might be interesting to use in a second analysis of these data later on.

## Recruitment
We are looking to recruit 74 Dutch children, approximately equally distributed between girls and boys between ages 5 and 17. **Another way of thinking about it is ~6 kids at each age, half of whom are girls.** Age will be treated as a continuous variable in the analysis, so there's no need to make exact age matches. It's also perfectly fine to recruit siblings. Here are the most important constraints on recruiting:

* The child must be between age 5 and 17 (inclusive).
* The child should not have any other language/cognitive deficit.
* If the child is 12 or older, they must themselves also consent to participation in the task.

I expect that, in many cases, we'll be dealing with married, heterosexual couples. Unmarried parents, single parents, same-sex couples, and other family arrangements are also very welcome in this study—we are interested in children's understanding about family terminology and roles, and that is an evolving concept in our modern society.

However, for the purposes of comparison with the homogenous sample on Rossel Island, we _are_ aiming to recruit 60–70 children who are being raised such that:

* They have two primary caregivers: an adult female as "mother" and an adult male as "father" (married or not).
* Both of the child's parents must _themselves_ have been raised in NL since birth.

We will make a background questionnaire such that we can separate these groups for inclusion in different analyses, as needed.

### Testing at MPI
In general, testing at the MPI will proceed similarly to other experiment-based data collection. That is: one participant at a time, parents contacted ahead of time by phone from the BRC database. It may be the case that two or more siblings fall in our age range, in which case it would make most sense to test them all in one session. Note that for at-MPI testing, parents should be sent the questionnaire together with the consent form ahead of time. Both can be collected, reviewed, and finalized at time of testing.

Note, too, that because we are sampling these participants from the MPI database, we should focus recruitment during MPI testing on children growing up speaking Dutch monolingually as a way of making sure we recruit mostly children from Duth backgrounds (for the comparison with Rossel Island).

Patricia, Nienke, and Marisa anticipate that most of the testing done at the MPI will cover the lower end of our target age range. Sibling information _is_ stored in the database, but not in an easily accessible/searchable way. Patricia will ask Kees to look into this for recruitment. For that reason, it is uncertain how many children will be available and what ages they will be.

There is also a challenge with parents bringing in school-aged children while the school year is in session. We may need to think about strategic testing times given school vs. holiday times of year.

### Testing elsewhere
We will likely test participants in "batches" on visits to schools, festivals, and the like to access age groups that are difficult to reach from the BRC database alone. This a very different kind of testing that will typically take a half- or whole-day commitment from Marisa and two experimenters (one of whom must have a drivers license).

For example, Patricia, Nienke, and Marisa talked about visiting one or two Gymnasia in Nijmegen to run a test session with whole classrooms of children in a single day. Keep in mind we only need about 30 children between ages 12 and 17, so this could be done in two (max three) visits with good planning!

In return, we would likely do something nice for the school, which might include an informal talk or demonstration for the children/teachers/parents and a tailored (but anonymized) report on the findings from each school. We'll see!

For these off-campus testing sessions, we will also need to contact parents ahead of time to send them the consent forms and questionnaires. How we can get this contact information ahead of time is yet to be determined. Note that, unlike our MPI-based testing, we can't pre-screen off-campus participants to see if they are likely to meet our comparison-sample criteria. For off-campus visits we will therefore be **maximally inclusive**, allowing participation by anyone in the classroom who is interested.

## Testing
The test-session is low-tech and should take no longer than 15 minutes (ideally only 5–10 minutes).

We will video-record the session with both the experimenter and the target child wearing head-mounted microphones. In the case that we are testing children at the MPI, parents will be asked to sit outside. In the case that we are testing children off campus, teachers and present parents will also be asked to wait outside. In the case that a parent insists on being present, they should be seated so that the child cannot easily see/hear their caregiver's responses during the test. For children 12 and older, check if they are okay with their parent being present during the test session—if not, thank the participants for their interest and move on to the next participant without testing.

### Materials involved
* Consent form(s): one from the parent, and a second from children 12 and older
* Fully filled-in background questionnaire
* Per experimenter:
  * 1 Zoom video camera or equivalent
  * 1 tripod
  * 2 head-mounted microphones
  * 2 XLR extension cables
  * A copy of the test questions, each marked with an ID for each participant
  * A notebook and pens
  * Two chairs in a semi-quiet, private room

### Test procedure
After you have welcomed the participant(s) and checked the status of the consent forms and background questionnaire (current versions: [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyGY2NfYpeE)), you may begin with testing by bringing the participant to the testing room.

1. Welcome the child into the room and show them where to sit.
  * If the parent/teacher insists on coming, make sure they have a chair and direct them where to sit and to please stay quiet so that they do not influence their child.
2. Explain to them what the microphone is for and, with their permission, put it on their head
  * Make sure it's comfortably placed for the participant but that the microphone is 2–3cm from one corner of their mouth, pointed directly toward the mouth.
3. Put your own microphone on and start the video recording.
  * Check that the video camera is in-focus.
  * State the participant ID aloud (from the test quesions form you are using).
4. Go through the questions on the KinshipNL_vragenlijst, one by one.
  * Current version [here](https://youtu.be/bVATtKo9UWA?t=45)
5. Monitor whether you should end the session early. That is, if:
  * The child becomes obviously unable to continue comfortably.
  * The child requests to leave.
  * 15 minutes have already elapsed.
  * You can say something like: "Thank you! You've been really helpful, and have already given me plenty of information. I think that's enough, let's go back!"
6. Thank the participant for their help and bring them back to the waiting area/classroom for debriefing
  * _Maybe_ we will compensate older children at this point (TBD; see below).
  * Do not share details of their response with their parents. You _can_ share information about how much their child enjoyed (or didn't enjoy the task) and apologize if the child was uncomfortable. If parents have specific follow-up questions, give them Nienke and/or Marisa's contact information.
  * For school-based testing, hold off on debriefing until all children have been tested.
7. Give the participant their compensation, if not yet already received.
  * €10 or a book for the MPI-tested kids; €10 otherwise.
  * **IMPORTANT**: we do not yet know how we will handle this in schools, but I think we will _not_ be giving children cash or vouchers in front of their classmates.
8. Bid the participant goodbye with a last thanks.

## Annotation
The video recordings need to be annotated, and the responses entered into a spreadsheet. The workflow for that process is as follows:

### Anotation in ELAN
We will annotate the videos using the KinshipNL Annotation Scheme, which is similarly structured to the ACLEW Annotation Scheme on which MPI assistants have been trained. This will involve:

* Marking out the stretches of time in which:
    * CHI: The child is giving a direct answer to a question (one stretch added for each sentence).
    * PMT: The experimenter is asking a test question (includes any time in which the experimenter and child are clarifying the question together; one long stretch including all that speech).
* For each stretch of speech, we will annotate the following:
    * CHI: minCHAT transcription of what the child says in Dutch.
        * _pmt@CHI_: The ID number of the test question their answer is associated with.
        * _try@CHI_: Whether the speech is the continuation of an answer following additional explanation/discussion with the experimenter.
    * PMT: The ID number of the test question being asked/discussed.
        * _try@PMT_: Whether the stretch of speech is a 2nd+ attempt at explanation/clarification after the child has started to answer.

It is **ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL** that we scrub final versions of these transcripts for all personal identifying information. That means we need to get rid of: all names of people, places, and institutions (any other types of proper names too), personal dates (e.g., date of birth), and other information that could be combined to identify the individual participant (languages, ethnicities, conditions, one-time events, phone numbers, etc.). Because some of this information is relevant for our analyses, we will use a practice of _arbitrary substitution_ to protect participants.

We will do this in two steps:

1. All information that needs to be substituted (see above) should be written with capital letters, marked for information type, and linked with underscores if it's multi-word, as follows:
    * Marisa@pi\_firstname
    * Casillas@pi\_lastname
    * Max\_Planck\_Institute@pi\_organization
    * Nijmegen@pi\_town
    * Verenigde\_Staten@pi\_nation
    * Americaanse@pi\_group
    * 12_Augustus@pi\_date
    * Mexicaanse@pi\_miscadj
    * Kletskoppen@pi\_miscnoun
    * 6525XD@pi\_miscnum
2. Marisa will then run a script to substitute the marked information with new information.
    * Note that replacements will be consistent within child, but not across children. So while "Nijmegen" might become "Kruilmik" for one child, it might be "Schijmbeek" for another.

If you think of more examples or come across something that doesn't easily fit into this list, please contact Marisa right away.

### Spreadsheet data entry
Two types of data must be entered into spreadsheets:

#### Participant responses

After a video has been annotated, the child's responses need to be coded in the analysis spreadsheet. The spreadsheet only contains the child's unique ID and their (simplified) responses as follows:

1. Mothers mothers named [integer]
2. Fathers fathers named [integer]
3. Uncles named [integer]
4. Aunts named [integer]
5. Father's uncles named [integer]
6. Father's aunts named [integer]
7. Mother's uncles named [integer]
8. Mother's aunts named [integer]
9. For each kin-type string [correct | incorrect]
10. For each kin-triangulation [correct | incorrect]
11. For each kin-marriage question [correct | incorrect]

#### Participant metadata

The background questionnaire should also be digitally encoded. It will include th child's unique ID as well as the following information about the child:

1. Age [integer]
2. Sex [M|F|NotReported]
3. Mothers mothers remembered [string]
4. Fathers fathers remembered [string]
5. Uncles [string]
6. Aunts [string]
7. Father's uncles [string]
8. Father's aunts [string]
9. Mother's uncles [integer]
10. Total # mother's aunts [integer]
11. Number of people living in the household [integer]
12. Number of older siblings [integer]
13. Number of younger siblings [integer]
14. Number of regular caregivers at home [integer]
15. Hours spent in daycare/school per week [integer]
16. Distance (km) from maternal grandparents [integer]
17. Distance (km) from paternal grandparents [integer]
18. Average time between visits with grandparents [days | weeks | months | years]
19. Average time between visits with aunts [days | weeks | months | years]
20. Average time between visits with uncles [days | weeks | months | years]
21. Average time between visits with non-family neighbors [days | weeks | months | years]
22. Frequency of large family gatherings [days | weeks | months | years]
23. Any comments given

Examples of different types of string responses:

* "Margarita\_Edna\_Margarita"
    * When the responder indicates that there are relatives of this type and that they have provided a full list.
* "Margarita\_Edna\_INCOMPLETE"
    * When the responder indicates that there are relatives of this type, but they do not (at this moment) know all the names.
* "INCOMPLETE"
    * When the responder indicates that there are relatives of this type, but they do not (at this moment) know any of the names.
* "NONE"
    * When the responder indicates that there are no relatives of this type.

Note that names of individuals are capitalized and strictly separated by underscores, with double names ("Peggy-Sue\_Linda-Marie\_Janet") separated by hyphens. The entries "NONE" and "INCOMPLETE" can be added when applicable (see examples above). **Keeping to these formatting standards is extremely important so that we can ensure privacy to the same standard as described above.**

## Analysis
All analysis will be completed in R by reading in and merging the response and metadata spreadsheets, as specified in the LaDD protocol, so that we can compare between the Rossel Island and Dutch test groups:

We aim first to just report the average scores and variance in scores for each of the tasks (1–3) across the two contexts.

We will then conduct linear or logistic (as appropriate) mixed-effects regression, one for each linguistic community, on each dependent measure, to see whether the same demographic predictors (e.g., child age and frequency of visits to relations) predict performance in the same way across measures, for example:

``` r
CoreTermAccuracyNL ~
    ChildAge * ChildSex + NumRelationsSeenPerWeek + TermCorpusFrequency +
    (1 | child) + (1 | term), data = NL
```
``` r
CoreTermAccuracyRI ~
    ChildAge * ChildSex + NumRelationsSeenPerWeek + TermCorpusFrequency +
    (1 | child) + (1 | term), data = RI
```

All models will include child age and random effects of child and item. All other predictors will only be included when they significantly improve fit in at least one population. Random slopes will be maximized to the extent possible, given convergence, and reduced by least to most strongly expected by-child or by-item effects.

## Archival
Published data for data inspection and reanalysis will only include the fully anonymized transcriptions and spreadsheets. All documents, data, and scripts will be archived at the MPI. All analysis-relevant, derived (i.e., no media), anonymized data will be secondarily stored on GitHub for easy re-use and re-development.
